# Scientific implementation plan and review gates

## P0 — initial conventional baseline (accepted and merged)

- [x] Add epistemic labels and explicitly flag the legacy notebook assumptions.
- [x] Implement the independent ideal-plate analytic electric pressure, force and stored-energy example.
- [x] Solve 2D Laplace Dirichlet potential for cylindrical electrode sections in a grounded enclosure.
- [x] Test the solver against exact linear harmonic potential and symmetry, boundary and scaling constraints.
- [x] Export a static figure labeling fields, units and separate analytic force results.
- [x] Add CI workflow.
- [x] Confirm remote CI checks after publishing this PR (verified workflow run 39187698432 on PR #5; confirms workflow execution and test pass, NOT physical validation of novel propulsion).

## P1 — numerical repairs and validations (accepted and merged)

- [x] Relocate 3D scalar source out of boundary damping and implement verifiable absorbing boundaries.
- [x] Resolve all frequencies at appropriate grid points/wavelength, then demonstrate convergence and known reflection benchmarks.
- [x] Validate discrete energy conservation and source normalization.
- [x] Add convergence and closed-contour stress integration for the electrostatic field; track reaction on grounded enclosure.

Merged to `main` at `8e1fdb32655d073002ae5a794b08e48f19a78a0f` following explicit owner authorization. [Issue #6](https://github.com/aguacatero/scalar-wave-viz/issues/6) closed.

## P2 — Exodus source-bounded reproduction (active; in progress)

- [ ] Select patent figure and transcribe exact claim and relevant equations with citations.
- [ ] Implement its geometry accurately; use 3D when 2D does not preserve force dimensions.
- [ ] Benchmark field solution and compute forces on **whole device** plus environment.
- [ ] Add H0-versus-H1 prediction comparison with error and experimental control panels.

*Status (2026-10-27):* Active on dedicated branch `p2-patent-geometry-exodus-2026-10-25` under Draft [PR #11](https://github.com/aguacatero/scalar-wave-viz/pull/11) ([Issue #7](https://github.com/aguacatero/scalar-wave-viz/issues/7)). Checkboxes remain unchecked pending independent scientific acceptance. Independent ChatGPT scientific review R1 ([issuecomment-6415952244](https://github.com/aguacatero/scalar-wave-viz/pull/11#issuecomment-6415952244)) concluded `CHANGES REQUIRED — P2 R1 NOT ACCEPTED` (6 High, 2 Medium findings). R2 remediation implements the 5-category parameter taxonomy (`PATENT_EXPLICIT_VALUE`, `DERIVED_FROM_PATENT`, `EXTERNAL_ESTIMATE_FOR_UNSPECIFIED`, `MODELING_ASSUMPTION`, `PATENT_OMITTED_UNKNOWN`), explicit separation of FIGS. 4–8 (single-stage schematic) vs FIG. 21 (9-blade epoxy test article), 1-cell-thick exterior surface masks (`100a`, `101a`, `100b`) with material-side quadrature and analytical uniform/nonuniform field regressions, non-tautological H0 whole-system force accounting summing direct enclosure wall tractions (`F_blade + F_ground + F_dielectric + F_wall`), analytic parallel-plate Maxwell-stress benchmark, a converged 3D SPD CG finite-difference solver with 6-face Maxwell stress integration and computed fringing ratio, programmatic controls (`+V` vs `-V`, `V=0`, symmetric capacitor, 180° spatial inversion BVP, asymmetric wall proximity coupling) with adversarial false-positive rejection gates, and accurate contextual characterization of Tajmar & Schreiber (2020). Awaiting independent ChatGPT R2 re-review.

## P3 — nuclear and scalar-field hypotheses

- [ ] Replace the hardcoded isotope half-lives and their false implication of wave speed with traceable evaluated/predicted nuclear data and error labels.
- [ ] Define an explicit scalar-field Lagrangian/equation and coupling, with known-physics limit and falsifiable prediction.
- [ ] Keep novel modes and speculative properties distinctly labeled.

## P4 — scientific research dashboard

- [ ] Interactive parameter controls, metadata download, independent sources, error bars and publishable static figures.
- [ ] Independent critical review before merging physics-bearing work.
